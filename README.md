Assumptions that I have considered:

While registering all the details mentioned in the user's schema are mandatory.
Same while posting a new job or applying for a job.


Job Posting
When a user posts a job so becomes the manager and he is able to post as many jobs as he wants.
The same user (manager) can be able to apply for other jobs.
Managers can do the following post a new job, update a job, delete a job and retrieve applications for his/her posted job. (authentication and authorization is needed.)

Application
Users can apply for jobs.
Users can update or delete their application/applications.
Authentication and authorization are needed so need to register and log in to get the token.

User
Users can see all the jobs available, they can filter out the jobs on the basis of skills, experience, and title. (no registration needed.)



Note: While testing please go through schema and routes once for better and easy testing.
